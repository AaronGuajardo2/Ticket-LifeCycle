<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- Intake
- Assignment and Communication
- Working on the Issue
- Resolution

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In this section, we'll create a ticket as a user and then receive the ticket as a help desk professional and familiarize ourselves with the process of resolving a ticket. First, go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and then click "Open a new ticket". Create a new ticket using the user account we created earlier. This user is reporting that mobile online banking is down. She is able to categorize this issue thanks to the help topics we added in the previous section.

Now, log in as an agent we created. In this instance, I logged in as Jane Doe and as we can see, the ticket we created is shown. Click on the ticket and now we can see information about the ticket and various things we can change. For this ticket, we will change the priority level to Emergency as this is a Business Impacting event. Also, we need to change the SLA plan to SEV-A to reflect the severity of the ticket that needs to be handled ASAP. In addition, the department responsible for handling this issue should be escalated to the System Administrators.

Within the ticketing platform, any changes made by any agent will be visible to all other agents in a thread format to enable faster ticketing resolution.

Looks like Jane was able to coordinate effectively with the Sysadmin. Jerry from System Engineering found out what was causing the problem and fixed the issue. The ticket is now under the closed section and everything is running as it should be!
